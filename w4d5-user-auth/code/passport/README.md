# Authentication Example

This example requires a PostgreSQL server up and running.

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your configuration.
2. Run the included Knex migrations with `npm run knex migrate:latest`
3. Start the app with `npm start`
4. You can also use nodemon with `npm run local`
